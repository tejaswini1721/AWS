Path is the complete location or name of where a computer, file, device, or web page is located.
Path specifies a unique location in a file system.
Absolute Path:

An Abolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch until the path to the desired dir/file is completed.
eg. C:\Users\teju\cdac\Cloud AWS
If you want to reuse the code use absolute path
Readability is high
Relative Path:

Absolute path name starts with working (current) directory.
. --> Working directory eg. cd . (working/current dir)

.. --> Working directory's parent directory eg. cd .. (current directory's parent)

It makes code dynamic
Readabilty is lost
Which one is best ?

It depends on situation that which path method is suitable for that situation.
